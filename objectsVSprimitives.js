1.When a new object is created it is stored in the heap with memory address then value itself
2.Me identifier points to new piece of memory in the stack
3.Memory in the stack points to the object in the heap by using memory address as its value
The piece of memory in the call stack has a reference to the piece of memory in the heap which hold(me) object which is why their called reference types! 
We do this because an object may be to large to be stored in the stack.
Friend can be const because youâ€™re not changing the value in the call stack your changing the value in the heap.
Primitive const values cannot be changed but reference values can be.
